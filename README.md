# CODTECH_TASK01
#  Weather Forecast Visualization (Task 01 - CODTECH Python Internship)

This project is part of **Task 01** of the **CODTECH Python Internship**. It demonstrates how to fetch weather data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap) and visualize it using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Requests** – For API calls
- **Matplotlib** – For plotting
- **Seaborn** – For enhanced visualizations
- **OpenWeatherMap API**


##  Objective

> Use Python to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and visualize it using line graphs.


##  How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecast-task.git
cd weather-forecast-task ```

### 2. Install Required Packages

pip install requests matplotlib seaborn


### 3. Add Your API Key

In the weather_forecast.py file:

API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'

You can get your API key from OpenWeatherMap.

### 4. Run the Script
python weather_forecast.py


A line graph showing the temperature forecast for the selected city will pop up.

---

### Output Sample
The script generates a line chart of the temperature forecast over the next few days using data from OpenWeatherMap.
